While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.</p>\n<p>In his 1931 autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.</p>\n<p>Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s <em>Praying Jew</em> is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of <em>The Praying Jew</em> before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.</p>\n",

However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.</p>\n",

By the late 1960s, the artist began using pointed, single words— chosen as much for their evocative power as for their phonetic qualities—as visual subjects in a variety of media. Between 1966 and 1969, Ruscha made a series of “liquid” or “wet” word paintings, in which the linguistic effect is made more palpable by the trompe l’oeil renderings of the words, which suggest that they have been created from water, oil, syrup, or another fluid.</p>\n",
